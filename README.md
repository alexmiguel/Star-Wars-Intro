# Star-Wars-Intro
Star Wars Intro with HTML5 + Javascript + CSS3D

This is an experimental use of Canvas animation, HTML5 audio tag use and CSS3D.
Trying to understand better javascript OOP, canvas animations and even github (this is my first repository).

The initial idea was to reacreate the intro of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsKzZtRwxw

The Star Wars logo is a simple canvas text animation.
The text is an scrolling DIV over another with CSS 3D perspective transformation.
Took the idea from https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/

The audio is a simple audio tag.
